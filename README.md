# OpenGL-Game "Don't Panic!
This is a game made to play with MySignals. MySignals is a development platform for medical devices and eHealth applications. It can connect to over 15 sensors. Main goal for this project was to control the movement of the player by using the MySignals airflow and SPO2 sensors.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
```
You need an android device (5.0 ->) to develop and test this application !
```
* [Android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) - Download and install
* [MySignals](http://www.my-signals.com/) - To unlock all functionalities of the application

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Steps

```
Step 1. Download or clone the repo to your working pc or laptop (https://github.com/hoangl8696/OpenGL-Game.).
```
```
Step 2. Connect your android device to your working station.
```

```
Step 3. If you have MySignals, you have to pair your phone with it via bluetooth.
Connect your sensors first before connecting power to MySignals.
```
```
Step 4. If you already paired, make sure MySignals and your phone are in bluetooth mode before starting the
application.
```
```
Step 5. Hit "run app" in android studio and deploy on your phone. (An emulator won't work because of bluetooth)
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
